This includes the insurer and reinsurer when you apply for insurance through us. Scottish Friendly becomes a data controller when a policy has been issued to you and will process your personal information for their legitimate business purposes, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>making decisions about whether to provide insurance and assistance services (such as claim assessment, claim processing and claim settlement);</li>\n <li>administering the policy, assessing and paying claims, and general customer service activities (including complaint resolution and claims disputes);</li>\n <li>detecting, investigating and preventing crime, including fraud and money laundering;</li>\n <li>carrying out market research and analysis;</li>\n <li>providing information about your policy in connection with any reinsurance; and</li>\n <li>complying with applicable laws and regulatory obligations (including laws and regulations outside of country of residence).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whenever Scottish Friendly uses your information for these purposes personal data rights are considered carefully and you have a right to opt-out of some of this processing. For more information on how Scottish Friendly uses your information, or how to opt-out, please see Scottish Friendly’s Privacy Policy at (<a href=\"https://www.scottishfriendly.co.uk/privacy-policy\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.scottishfriendly.co.uk/privacy-policy</a>).</p>\n<p>In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties we partner with, to provide you with additional products, services or promotional offers you have applied for.</p>\n<p>We may also share your personal information with legal and regulatory bodies such as the Financial Conduct Authority, the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Information Commissioner’s Office, to fulfil a legal or regulatory obligation, assist with an investigation, or demonstrate compliance.</p>\n<p>If we sell our company or part of it, we will share your information with the purchaser, who may then provide you with information on their products and services.</p>\n<p>We may transfer and process any personal information you provide to us to countries outside the European Economic Area. Again, we will ensure that all adequate safeguards are in place in connection with such transfer and that all necessary consent has been obtained.</p>\n<p><strong>How we use your information to make automated decisions</strong></p>\n<p>To assess your eligibility for cover we may use systems to make automated decisions based on personal information we collect from you. This involves us asking you to answer Health and Lifestyle questions when applying for cover under our Life Insurance Policy. The decision to provide cover is based on the answers you provide. These decisions do not involve human input, and the software and systems apply predefined logic programming and criteria to make a decision and assess how we deal with you in connection with the provision of services.&nbsp;We will hold this data safe and secure at all times.</p>\n<p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing, to express your point of view and contest the automated decision. You do not have to take part in this underwriting process, but if you don't Scottish Friendly won't be able to provide you with an insurance policy. If you do not wish to be subject to Scottish Friendly’s automated decision-making process, we will be unable to continue with this application.</p>\n<p><strong>If you choose not to give personal information</strong></p>\n<p>We may need to collect personal information by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you.</p>\n<p>If you choose not to give us this personal information, it may delay or prevent us from meeting our obligations. It may also mean that we cannot perform services needed to administer your policy. It could also mean that we cancel a product you have with us.</p>\n<p>Any data collection that is optional will be made clear at the point of collection.</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>\n<p>We will only use your personal information to send you marketing messages to tell you about relevant products and services or offers that may be of interest to you if we have a valid reason to do so under data protection legislation. The two main reasons we rely on are where we have your consent, or if we have a legitimate interest to do so.</p>\n<p>When we rely on legitimate interests, we will issue you with marketing that we think will be of interest to you. We will only do this when we believe that our legitimate interests do not override your privacy rights.</p>\n<p>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages and update your choices by&nbsp;contacting us at any time.</p>\n<p>Whatever you choose, you will still receive important information such as changes to your existing products.</p>\n<p><strong>How long we keep your personal information</strong></p>\n<p>We maintain a data retention policy which governs how long we will keep your personal data for. We retain personal data about our customers and prospective customers. We will only keep your information for as long as reasonably required to demonstrate we have met our obligations to you and the rules that apply to us.</p>\n<p>We will keep your personal information for as long as you are a customer. After you stop being a customer, we will keep your data for up to 7 years for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>to respond to any questions or complaints</li>\n <li>to show that we treated you fairly</li>\n <li>to maintain records according to rules that apply to us</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may keep your data for longer than 7 years if we cannot delete it for legal, regulatory or technical reasons.
